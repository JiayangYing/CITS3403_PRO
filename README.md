## Installation

#### Setting Up the Project
Follow these steps to clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, and install dependencies:

**1. Clone the Repository**

- First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JiayangYing/CITS3403_PRO.git
cd <repository_directory>
```

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**

We recommend using venv to create a virtual environment. Detailed instructions can be found in the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

**Create the Virtual Environment**

In the root directory of the cloned repository, execute the following command:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```
This command creates a virtual environment named venv.

**Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment using the command specific to your operating system:

- **For Linux and macOS:**
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

- **For Linux and macOS:**
```sh
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
You'll know the virtual environment is active when `(venv)` appears at the beginning of your command line prompt.

**3. Install Dependencies**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:
``` sh
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-wtf
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-mail
```
If still having problem please install all dependency from requirment.txt
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to configure environment variables. The `.env` file should contain key-value pairs for your environment-specific settings.
Hereâ€™s an example of what the `.env` file might look like:
``` sh
ELASTICSEARCH_URL = http://localhost:9200
MAIL_SERVER = smtp.googlemail.com
MAIL_PORT = 587
MAIL_USE_TLS = 1
MAIL_EMAIL = <your_email>
MAIL_USERNAME = <your_username>
MAIL_PASSWORD = <email_password>
```
You should now have a fully set up development environment with all dependencies installed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with `app.db` such as database schema or you need to reset it, the following commands might be useful:
```sh
flask db downgrade base
flask db upgrade
```

## Initialisation

To start the application, run following command:
```sh
python3 flask run
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5000

## Run tests

To run tests for the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project:
```sh
   cd your-repo-name
```
2. Run the test command:
```sh
   python -m unittest discover tests
```
Test results will be displayed in the terminal window.

## Deliverables
The "deliverables" folder contains progress updates captured as short screen-capture videos (.mp4) or image files (.jpeg, .png). Each file corresponds to a specific milestone in the project.
