# EcoHUB

EcoHUB is a platform dedicated to connecting sellers and buyers within Australia, focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-17) and incorporating SDG-8, SDG-10, SDG-12, and SDG-13. EcoHUB enables the sale and purchase of second-hand or recyclable products, fostering a community-driven marketplace that promotes sustainability and economic inclusiveness.

## Description

EcoHUB is developed to provide a robust, user-friendly platform that aligns with sustainable development goals by promoting the reuse and recycling of products. It enables sellers to list their second-hand or recyclable products and manage their inventories efficiently. Buyers can browse, filter, and order products with ease. The platform supports essential functionalities like email verification, profile management, and comprehensive order handling, ensuring a secure and smooth transaction experience.

The backend is powered by Flask, ensuring efficient handling of user requests and interactions, while the frontend uses Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design. Elasticsearch enhances the search capabilities, and thorough testing with unit and Selenium tests ensures system reliability.

## Purpose

EcoHUB's primary goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform for Australians to buy and sell second-hand and recyclable products. This initiative aims to support sustainable development by reducing waste, promoting recycling, and fostering economic opportunities in line with specific Sustainable Development Goals.

## Installation
To run EcoHub locally, follow these steps:

## Before anything make sure python and pip are installed in your system/wsl
Clone the repo and set up your preferred virtual environment. We have used venv. Refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for detailed instructions. The easiest way is to locate the clone repo in your terminal/wsl, and in the main directory execute: python3 -m venv venv
This will create the target directory for your virtual env. Next you need to activate it. This is done via:
**source venv/bin/activate**
You'll know it is active when (venv) appears on the command line before your username.
Inside your virtual env all dependancies need to be installed, to do this run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## To run tests use:
**pytest**

The following tests are included:
All routes defined in routes.py are checked for status 200
User account creation and login
User applying for a job, poster receiving application
Jobs being returned from search
User profile page displaying relevant data
Multiple db queries
## To launch app use:
 **flask run**
 
The application has been built to automatically create a db for you and perform all migrations in the background before the app launch
Once the flask development server is running follow the link provided
Initially the db will be empty. In order to simulate user interactions the /populate page has been created. This will allow you to populate the db with dummy data. To use this feature, add /populate  to the end of your development server ip. Then Follow the prompts displayed on the webpage to create dummy data. This might include options to specify the amount or type of data to generate.
Once the database is populated, you can interact with the application using the provided features such as login, signup, buying and selling, ordering, and product listingï¼Œexplore the different functionalities and simulate user interactions as needed.
